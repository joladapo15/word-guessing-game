# Word Guessing Game (WGG)
A simple Python word-guessing game. The Player tries to guess a hidden word one letter (or full word) at a time. This project is designed as a beginner-friendly coding exercise to practice fundamental Python concepts, including I/O, control flow, functions, and basic game logic.

## Features / Goals 
- Playable in the terminal/command line.
- Guess a letter or attempt the full word.
- Track remaining attempts and show progress (e.g., `_ _ a _ _ `).
- Basic input validation (ignore repeated guesses, non-letter inputs).
- Simple scoring and option to play multiple rounds.

## Planned / TODO
- [ ] Refactor into functions and a `Game` class
- [ ] Add difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- [ ] Save high scores to a local file
- [ ] Add unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Add CLI arguments (e.g., `--difficulty`)

## Technologies
- Python 3.8+
